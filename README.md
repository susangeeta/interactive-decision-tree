# Interactive Decision Tree

This is an interactive decision tree that guides users through a series of questions to recommend a personalized travel destination based on their preferences.

## Questions:

1. Do you prefer the mountains or the beach?
2. Are you looking for adventure or relaxation?
3. Whatâ€™s your budget? (Low, Medium, High)

## How to Use:

1. Select your answers from the dropdown menus.
2. Once all selections are made, the app will generate a personalized recommendation for your trip.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS (with animations)
- Vanilla JavaScript

## Research:

- Random number generation and templating to dynamically insert user answers into recommendations.
- CSS animations for a more engaging UI.

## Future Improvements:

- Add more questions and travel destinations.
- Enhance the recommendation algorithm with more complex logic.
- Use a backend service to save user preferences and offer multiple recommendations.

## How to Run:

- Download or clone the repository.
- Open `index.html` in any web browser.
